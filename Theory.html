    <h3 align = "center">Background and Theory</h3>

    <p style="font-size:20px">&nbsp  A knuckle joint is a type of joint which connects two cylindrical rods whose 
        axis lies on the same plane and are under a tensile load. It is used to  transmit axial tensile <br> &nbsp 
        force.This joint allows angular movement of the two cylindrical rods in one plane.
        Knuckle joint is named so as it uses a knuckle pin to join the two cylindrical rods.
